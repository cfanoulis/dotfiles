  pf = pull --ff-only

  # pull with rebase - to provide a cleaner, linear, bisectable history.
  #
  # To automatically do "pull --rebase" everywhere:
  #
  #     git config --global pull.rebase true
  #
  # To automatically do "pull --rebase" for any branch based on master:
  #
  #    git config branch.master.rebase true
  #
  # To automatically do "pull --rebase" for any newly-created branches:
  #
  #     git config --global branch.autosetuprebase always
  #
  # To integrate changes between branches, you can merge or rebase.
  #
  # When we use "git pull", git does a fetch then a merge.
  # If we've made changes locally and someone else has pushed changes
  # to our git host then git will automatically merge these together
  # and create a merge commit that looks like this in the history:
  #
  #    12345678 - Merge branch 'foo' of bar into master
  #
  # When we use "git pull --rebase", git does a fetch then a rebase.
  # A rebase resets the HEAD of your local branch to be the same as
  # the remote HEAD, then replays your local commits back into repo.
  # This means you don't get any noisy merge messages in your history.
  # This gives us a linear history, and also helps with git bisect.
  #
  pr = pull --rebase

  ### rebase ###

  # rebase - forward-port local commits to the updated upstream head.
  rb = rebase

  # rebase abort - cancel the rebasing process
  rba = rebase --abort

  # rebase - continue the rebasing process after resolving a conflict manually and updating the index with the resolution.
  rbc = rebase --continue

  # rebase - restart the rebasing process by skipping the current patch.
  rbs = rebase --skip

  # rbi - rebase interactive on our unpushed commits.
  #
  # Before we push our local changes, we may want to do some cleanup,
  # to improve our commit messages or squash related commits together.
  #
  # Let's say I've pushed two commits that are related to a new feature and
  # I have another where I made a spelling mistake in the commit message.
  # When I run "git rbi" I get dropped into my editor with this:
  #
  #     pick 7f06d36 foo
  #     pick ad544d0 goo
  #     pick de3083a hoo
  #
  # Let's say I want to squash the "foo" and "goo" commits together,
  # and also change "hoo" to say "whatever". To do these, I change "pick"
  # to say "s" for squash; this tells git to squash the two together;
  # I also edit "hoo" to rename it to "whatever". I make the file look like:
  #
  #     pick 7f06d36 foo
  #     s ad544d0 goo
  #     r de3083a whatever
  #
  # This gives me two new commit messages to edit, which I update.
  # Now when I push the remote repo host receives two commits
  #
  #     3400455 - foo
  #     5dae0a0 - whatever

  #
  # Show churn for whole repo:
  #
  #   $ git churn
  #
  # Show churn for specific directories:
  #
  #   $ git churn app lib
  #
  # Show churn for a time range:
  #
  #   $ git churn --since=1-month-ago
  #
  # These are all standard arguments to `git log`.
  #
  # It's possible to get valuable insight from history of a project not only
  # by viewing individual commits, but by analyzing sets of changes as a whole.
  # For instance, `git churn` compiles stats about which files change the most.
  #
  # For example, to see where work on an app was focused on in the past month:
  #
  #     $ git churn --since=1-month-ago app/ | tail
  #
  # This can also highlight potential problems with technical debt in a project.
  # A specific file changing too often is generally a red flag, since it probably
  # means the file either needed to be frequently fixed for bugs, or the file
  # holds too much responsibility and should be split into smaller units.
  #
  # Similar methods of history analysis can be employed to see which people were
  # responsible recently for development of a certain part of the codebase.
  #
  # For instance, to see who contributed most to the API part of an application:
  #
  #    $ git log --format='%an' --since=1-month-ago app/controllers/api/ | \
  #      sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head
  #
  #    109 Alice Anderson
